                     Starting a business is tough. Founders often face overwhelming
                     challenges: validating ideas, creating business models, writing
                     pitches, planning product roadmaps, and finding the right growth
                     strategies. Without proper guidance, time and resources are wasted,
                    leading to high failure rates.
